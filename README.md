### Kookmin University NetApp Lab first simulation kit
This project is to demonstrate an automation of simulations
This project compares two algorithms of TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem). 
One is a greedy algorithm called nearest, which visit the node nearest to the current position. 
Second one is to use simulated annealing. 

The following is to run the two simulations. 
The number of nodes varies from 10 to 50 in 1000 * 1000 area. 
The simulation is done 3 times per each number of nodes. 
We show the min, average, and max distances over the number of nodes.
